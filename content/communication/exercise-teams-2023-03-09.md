Dear all, 

when registering you have indicated that you wanted to be assigned to a team by organizers.

We have worked very hard to make that happen but it was too difficult for us to manage this. We expect over 300
participants and the scheduling and coordination effort to form teams and to reliably communicate
this information and connection details across spam filters and also managing no-shows or no-answers
is too tricky and risky for us. We decided to focus and optimize for excellent workshop experience
instead of spending significant time arranging and rearranging teams.

However, it is not a problem to participate on your own. You will still get the full workshop experience.

And it is not too late to form a small team with colleagues of yours!

Thank you for your understanding! My main regret is that those who volunteered to be a team leader for
a "random" team might not get the team lead experience. Please still consider joining our on-boarding
for team leads if you are interested: 
- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule 
- Zoom link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)

On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,

Radovan and Matias
