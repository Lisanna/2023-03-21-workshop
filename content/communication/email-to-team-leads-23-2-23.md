Dear participant,

You get this email because you have indicated interest in "being a team leader" or that you "might form a team with your colleagues". We sincerely appreciate your interest and want to offer support.

**Team leader**

A team leader encourages the team to discuss and ask questions. They can help the team but we assume them to be learners themselves, not experts. A team leader can handle posting team's questions to the Q&A document or encourage the team to write.

- If you have a team: have some way to contact your team to fix meeting time and place. We do not follow or interfere with your team's communication.
- If you don't have a team: you can either gather a team or let us know that you are available. This is done later via the registration form. We will send information on this closer to the workshop.

We recommend all Team leads participate one of the onboarding sessions. See the schedule in https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule

**Forming a team with your colleagues**

We want to encourage everyone to gather together to follow the stream and collaborate on exercises (we refer to this as "team"). You can make it as low effort as you want. Some steps we recommend:
- book a space for the team
- make sure that the team knows when and where to meet
- have someone from the team to participate one onboarding session (see schedule in https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule)

More information

We will add additional fields in the registration form closer to the workshop. Please follow the email communication.

Greetings,  
CodeRefinery team
