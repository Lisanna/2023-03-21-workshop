Dear participant,

You get this email because you have indicated interest in "being a helper, co-instructor, or observer". We sincerely appreciate your interest and want to offer support.

**Observer**

We invite people to follow the workshop and offer some "behind the scenes" view to our Zulip chat [1] and planning document [2]. Feel free to ask anything in Zulip!

Please also join one of our onboarding sessions before the workshop to see how that works and get info on the workshop technicalities. (see schedule in [3])

**General helper** 

We acknowledge people's skills in our topics and welcome you to join as a helper. You can follow the Q&A in our collaborative document (HackMD or similar) and join the learner Zoom (or similar) to answer learners' questions directly.

Please contact us via support@coderefinery.org or our Zulip chat [1] and tell what you would be interested in:
- Helping in Zoom or Q&A document?
- Any spesific topics? (list in workshop schedule [3])

Please also join one of our onboarding sessions to get info on the workshop technicalities. (see schedule in [3])

We provide tasklists for each role in the workshop planning document [2] and in workshop playbook [4].

**Co-teacher and co-organiser**

We are beyond words happy if someone wants to teach with us (co-teacher/co-instructor) or help us with workshop organising (co-organiser). 

Please contact us via support@coderefinery.org or our Zulip chat [1] and tell which topic you would be interested in. (list in workshop schedule [3])
