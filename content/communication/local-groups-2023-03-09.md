Dear all,

when registering you have indicated that you were interested in following in-person.

There are a number of local events that we know of:
- right hand side of: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/

If you are part of those, the local organizer has hopefully reached out to you
and you will get information about how to join exercise sessions from them.
Otherwise please reach out to us at support@coderefinery.org.

There were also many groups in various places who might be interested in
following in-person but we don't know whether you are in contact and are
already arranging an exercise room:
- Chalmers: 2
- DTU: 2
- Karolinska: 2
- Lund: 4
- Stockholm University: 2
- UiO: 2
- UiT: 5
- Uppsala: 4

If you are in one of those places and would like to organize your group, can you please reach out to us at support@coderefinery.org?

If you are in one of those places and you don't hear from us or from a local
organizer, then we were not able to find a local organizer. In this case please
follow the workshop on your own and don't worry: you will still get the full
workshop experience, including exercises.

On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,

Radovan and Matias
