Dear all,

our workshop starts in less than two weeks and we are so excited to have you on board: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/

The workshop will stream at: https://twitch.tv/coderefinery. You don't need a Twitch account. You only need a browser.
For the exercise sessions you can either follow on your own on as part of a group (more info below).

Below we summarize what you can expect and what you need to prepare. If your schedule changed and you cannot attend this time, please consider subscribing to our newsletter to get the information about upcoming events: https://coderefinery.org/#newsletter


**Q&A during the workshop**

We will use a HedgeDoc collaborative document for questions and answers and "real-time" communication during the workshop. Everyone can read and write in that document. Please use caution and do not remove text that is not yours.
Save the link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)

Here are notes from our last workshop so that you can see where this is going: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/questions/


**Preparing for the workshop**

Please go through our software installation instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/

This takes some time but with a workshop of this size (we expect over 300 participants), we cannot start installing and debugging during the workshop. We will also soon add a verification script that can give you feedback whether all requirements are met.

We hope that you will drop by in one of our install help sessions:
- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule
- Zoom link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)


**For those who wanted to be assigned to a team as learner or team lead**

There's still time to gather friends and colleagues to follow the workshop with you. If you have/get a team, we suggest you organize a video/in-person meeting for each day you want to participate the workshop.

Unfortunately we realized that we do not have the resources to form teams from individuals who do not know each other yet and we need to rely that teams self-organize. But don't worry, also participating as individual means you get the full workshop experience.


**For those who were interested in following in-person**

We will reach out to you in a separate email and we will try to help you to connect with others in the same location.


**Local organisers**

Please let us know if there is anything we can help with. Please check that you are listed here: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#partners and reach out to support@coderefinery.org if you want to be mentioned.


**Helpers, team leads, and observers**

Please attend one of our two onboarding sessions (if this is not your first workshop):
- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule
- Zoom link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)


We wish you all a happy and educating workshop!
On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,

Radovan and Matias
